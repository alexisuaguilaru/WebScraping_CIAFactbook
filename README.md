## Introduction
Web Scrapping becomes a valuable tool for obtaining data from different sources such as web pages, as well as to create datasets that will be used to train Machine Learning models. They can also be used for data analysis in order to generate new knowledge.

Among the factors that influence a country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) are those related to technological progress and its availability in society, among people, with the number of Internet users being the main technological factor. Therefore, it is essential to study the relationship between this technological service and the purchasing power of a country.

## General Aim
The purpose of this project is to practice obtaining data through Web Scrapping from [The World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/) and to analyze the relationship between GDP and the percentage of Internet users in a country. In addition to achieving this purpose, the requirements in [[1]](#references) are also followed.
